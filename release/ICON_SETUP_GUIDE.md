# Adding Logo to Your Executable

## Current Status
✅ Logo file copied to `assets/lucrum-logo.jpeg`
✅ Resource files prepared for Windows compilation
✅ Build process updated to include icon assets

## Quick Steps to Add Logo to EXE

### Method 1: Online Conversion (Recommended)
1. **Convert JPEG to ICO:**
   - Go to https://convertio.co/jpeg-ico/ or https://www.icoconvert.com/
   - Upload your `assets/lucrum-logo.jpeg` file
   - Download the converted ICO file
   - Replace `assets/app-icon.ico` with the downloaded file

2. **Rebuild the executable:**
   ```bash
   npm run build-exe
   ```

### Method 2: Using Windows Tools (Advanced)
If you have access to a Windows machine:

1. **Install Resource Compiler** (part of Visual Studio Build Tools)
2. **Compile the resource file:**
   ```cmd
   rc assets/app.rc
   ```
3. **Link with PKG** (requires additional configuration)

## Current Build Process

Your `package.json` now includes:
- Icon creation script: `npm run create-icon`
- Updated build script: `npm run build-exe`
- Icon assets included in PKG bundle

## Files Created

1. **assets/app.rc** - Windows resource file with version info
2. **assets/app-icon.ico** - Icon file (placeholder, replace with proper ICO)
3. **assets/lucrum-logo.jpeg** - Your original logo

## What Happens Next

When you run `npm run build-exe`:
1. TypeScript compiles to JavaScript
2. Icon resources are prepared
3. PKG bundles everything into `simple-pos-middleware.exe`
4. Icon assets are included in the bundle

## Visual Result

Once you replace the ICO file and rebuild:
- ✅ Your executable will show the Lucrum logo in Windows Explorer
- ✅ The logo will appear in the taskbar when running
- ✅ File properties will show your company information

## Testing

After rebuilding with the proper ICO file:
1. Check the executable icon in Windows Explorer
2. Right-click → Properties to see version information
3. Run the application to see the taskbar icon

**Next Steps:**
1. Convert your JPEG to ICO using the online tool
2. Replace `assets/app-icon.ico` with the converted file  
3. Run `npm run build-exe` to rebuild with the icon
